          <strong>Web development is a broad term for the work involved in developing a web site for 
            the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). This can include 
            web design, web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, 
            web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development. 
            However, among web professionals, "web development" usually refers to the main 
            non-design aspects of building web sites: writing markup and coding. Web 
            development can range from developing the simplest static single page of plain text to 
            the most complex web-based internet applications, electronic businesses, or social network services.</strong>

          <strong>
            Since the mid-1990s, web development has been one of the fastest growing industries 
in the world. In 1995 there were fewer than 1,000 web development companies in the 
United States, but by 2005 there were over 30,000 such companies[citation needed] in 
the U.S. alone. The growth of this industry is being pushed by large businesses wishing 
to sell products and services to their customers and to automate business workflow.

            Web development takes into account many security considerations, such as data entry 
error checking through forms, filtering output, and encryption.[1] Malicious practices 
such as SQL injection can be executed by users with ill intent yet with only primitive 
knowledge of web development as a whole. Scripts can be exploited to grant 
unauthorized access to malicious users trying to collect information such as email 
addresses, passwords and protected content like credit card numbers
